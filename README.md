muse-bright-neurofeedback

muse bright, it is my intention to do neurofeeback training with muse for the brain for attention.
It uses the muse-lsl and brightness libraries from macos to work.
At the moment it's all messed up but it's functional for what I personally need.
The training takes care of reducing theta waves, highbeta and increasing SMR waves. Which from several papers I have read help to improve attention.

I use it when watching videos and when I want to train my brain.
I recently added the pause and play option which honestly works better than turning the brightness up or down because it gives more direct feedback.
 
Probably the play and pause option works in windows because it is just pressing the space key but not the brightness option.
